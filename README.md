# react-fiesta

This repository is dedicated for the projects that I am about to develop with React/Redux or with both.

***********************

<b>"Pics"</b> is an app designed to work like an image search engine, but only in a limited manner. It fetches image data depending on the searching criteria of the user from <a href="https://www.unsplash.com">Unsplash</a>.

***********************

<b>"Songs"</b> is an implementation of how Redux works with React. A very simple but efficient understanding of the use of this state management application.

***********************

<b>"YouTube API"</b> is a complete implementation of how to work with APIs in React. Specifically, for this project I worked on YouTube APIs and used them to search and show videos on an embedded YT player.

***********************

<b>"Blog"</b> is a simple implementation of redux-thunk to make async api calls.

***********************

<b>"button-for-kazi"</b> is an implementation of redux to keep log of Sign In and Out of Kazi da's office hours. <i>PROBABLY</i> I will convert it into a redux-thunk project. Time will tell.
